Hi,

I pass all your requirements. My goal is to work in Germany in Machine Learning. I think your internship is perfect for me.

Beside knowledge in ML/AI. I do have a lot of programming experience. Which means I'm comfortable cleaning data, using the terminal and automating a data pipeline.

I do fit all of your requirements and most of your "plus" requirements. I'm ready and will actually help the company.
%  I pursued my degree in "M.Sc of Mathematics in Network and Data Science". After that, I started a Phd of Machine learning while also working on an non-profit NLP project (LangxLang.com) that optimizes language learning using AI. Before that I had experience in video games and web development using different technologies, which made me a well-rounded programmer.
  
%I built a very deep understanding of different AI models. So far, I've worked on generative models, and many NLP tasks. Moreover, being a well-rounded programmer means I'm comfortable working with different kind of databases, manipulating data, and even building data pipelines. Moreover, I have a a good experience working with the Linux terminal and docker.

%I decided to stop my academic studies and find an interesthttps://www.ybadran.coming job related to data science. I'm mostly interested in NLP related jobs, which was my focus in the past year. %I'm both ready for that in theory (theoretical understanding of data science) and in application (I did a lot of projects from collecting data to implementing models from scratch).

%In my application I set my German language skills as elementary. However, I'm working hard and effectively to improve my German skills.

Thanks for your time and consideration.

%%%%respond-to-requierments%%%% I fit all your requirements, and almost all your "nice-to-have" requirements. I was happy to see this requirement: "You do data science outside of notebooks", I do. Also, "You have experience with clustering algorithms.", my Master program focus was on clustering algorithms and my thesis as well.

%I'm a well-rounded programmer. I worked on video games, web and Android. Later, I was interested in applying AI in video games. That's why I pursued my degree in "M.Sc of Mathematics for Network and Data Science". After the program I started LangXlang.com a non-profit language learning platform. My responsibilities included data processing with python, handling databases and deploying them with Docker on Linux servers. After graduation, I was also involved with Quantum AI research at my university after graduation. I stopped due to lack of funding.


%I'm sure I fit your requirements as follows:
%\begin{outline}
%    \1 A relevant degree, experience as a ML Engineer (preferably 2+ years experience)
%        \2 I have a related M.SC degree in the subject plus I worked on different ML projects including "LangXLang.com".
%    \1  You know common programming languages, concepts, and architectures (Python in particular)
%        \2 I'm very skillful programmer with a lot of experience.
%    \1 Experience working with cloud infrastructure and data pipelines
%        \2 Cloud infrastructure is a big topic, but being an extreme enthusiast of Linux and Docker and having done deployment on different clouds might make me a match.
%\end{outline}

%Thanks a lot for your time considering me. I'm looking forward to hearing from you. 

%Sincerly Yours,

%Unfortunately, my previous work experience doesn't make me very competitive for an AI job. That's why I'm looking for a technical job as a software developer which I also like.

%I have already applied for another position at your company, where more customer support is needed. I noticed that I also fit the requirements on this job post so I apply again.



%I think I'm a perfect fit for more than one job post at InnoGames. First, I'm a video game developer. Second, I had a lot of training in data science. I'm mainly interested in your job post "Junior Data Scientist" as I want to start a data science career. However, I'm open to any other tech job post you have (even your Linux job, because it's my daily OS).

%For video games and specially Unity, I built two successful libraries on the Unity Asset store and other open-source contributions that you can find on my CV/linked-in. For Data Science, I have developed a good theoretical knowledge on different topics due to my Applied Mathematics course. I also had first-hand experience working on LangXLang.com, an NLP project with two collaborators from different countries. I'm responsible for collecting data, processing, and saving in both MongoDB and MySQL.

%All in all, I love your company, your games style, and Hamburg :). I think I can be a great addition. 

%I'm a well-rounded programmer with experience in different technologies. I worked on video games, web and Android.% Later, I was interested in applying AI in video games. That's why I pursued my degree in "M.Sc of Mathematics in Network and Data Science". \iffalse This unique program exposed me to different data science ideas from simple linear regression to the more complex deep learning models.\fi \iffalse change\fi During the program, I got more interested in data related jobs, that's why I'm applying to this job opening.
%I'm a programmer with experience in different technologies. I worked on video games, web and Android. I have many projects which you can check on my Github. I'm 

%I just love your requirements, espeicially the ones related to Linux. I'd love to work on such tasks. I'm not sure if I fit your requirements exactly, but I'm very excited for such positions and I'd work hard to fit what you want. 

%%%First, being a well-rounded programmer means I can extract/scrap and clean data, access databases, and do common automation tasks (especially with Linux server). Second, I have a good theoretical understanding of Machine learning research (I can read and apply them).


%I'm writing to apply for the job titled "Developer Immersive Products VR/AR/MR".

%A big portion of my experience is related to video games. I also developed some assets for the Unity game engine (some proprietary for my previous company). Moreover, I worked with web technologies and loved to do the back-end as much as the front end.

%While I'm mainly interested in data science jobs, I saw that you are using machine learning for some tasks that's why I'm applying. I love to combine graphics and machine learning.

%I fit all of your requirements except for "experience in building either VR or AR applications". While I did help some people do projects related to VR/AR, I myself did not do a project related to VR/AR. 

%I don't have a degree in Business Informatics exactly, and I used Azure for not more than one month (instead I use digital Ocean/Linode). Other than that I fit your requirements.

%I fit all of your requirement. \iffalse change\fi Except that I've never used PyQt (This is easily manageable).
%I think I fit all your requirements. Even XML and PHP which is a "nice-to-have", but I didn't put them on my CV. For XML, I did a lot of work on extracting data from XCES OPUS files (an xml). For PHP I needed to edit word-press code in my previous company. 

%\textbf{Note:} I was until recently part of the Quantum AI research group at HS Mittweida which I've not included in the CV as it's not related.

%After my Computer Engineering degree, I worked on Web, Android, graphics, and video game development. Then I got interested in Machine learning and statistics (mainly because I was interested in Generative Models) which motivated me to get my degree in Applied Mathematics in Data Science (M.Sc.).\par

%  I'm a very good programmer and can tackle professional projects. Most of my work was not related to Data Science, that's why I'm applying as a junior.\par
  
%I have strong theoretical knowledge in Machine Learning and I'm able to read cutting-edge research and apply it. This was acquired through both my studies (M.Sc in Applied Math.) and personal projects.

%Lately, I've been working with a team from my home country on a future non-commercial language learning platform. I was responsible for all data processing and model building.
 
% On the other hand, I love automation specially when it's done using Linux. This is actually where most of my experience lie. So I hope you consider me.
 
 %I definitely fit all your requirements, please consider me.
